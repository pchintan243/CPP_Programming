// STL --> standard template library
// Library for what?
// Generic classes and functions

// For competitive programming You must need to learn STL Concept
// Because when ever you have limited time and work load is very high then it will save your time to code.

// Components of STL
// 1. Containers --> Object which stores data, use template classed
// 2. Algorithm --> sorting, searching, use template function, Procedure to process data
/* 3. Iterators --> objects which points to an element of a container
                --> handle just like a pointers
                // --> connects algorithms with containers
